# QR-Dice: 6-sided QR-cube

**Update:** It got [Hack of the Month @ Berlin Hack&Tell #100](https://bhnt.c-base.org/2024-10-29-no100-annivercary).


Is it possible to arrange a number of cubes in a 3D grid inside a 21x21x21 cube so that projections from each face display six different QR codes, each with its own message?

The answer is **yes**.
